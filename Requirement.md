1. Professional work mainly involve microsoft teams
2. Some of the tasks are in ms planner
3. some are in notion
4. some are in excel files
5. some are not recorded

Need to create the app to connect to all this so the task list keep updating itself. also it should give a graph kind of view see all dependencies and sense of priority how should i proceed.  this should be the ultimate planner app for my life.

The app should be accessible from both mobile and web. mobile first web app would do.
