# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Unified Task Planner is a comprehensive application that aggregates tasks from multiple sources and platforms into a single, unified interface. This system will allow users to view, manage, and organize all their tasks from various task management platforms (Microsoft Planner, Notion, Excel files, etc.) in one centralized location, eliminating the need to switch between multiple applications to track their work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a busy professional, I want to see all my tasks from different platforms in one place, so that I can have a complete overview of my workload without switching between multiple applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into the system THEN the system SHALL display tasks from all connected platforms in a unified dashboard
2. WHEN tasks are updated on external platforms THEN the system SHALL reflect these changes within 15 minutes
3. WHEN a user connects a new platform THEN the system SHALL automatically import existing tasks from that platform
4. IF a platform connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with multiple task management tools, I want to connect my Microsoft Planner, Notion, and Excel task lists, so that I can aggregate all my tasks without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates platform connection THEN the system SHALL provide OAuth authentication for supported platforms
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL import all accessible tasks from the connected platform
3. WHEN a user disconnects a platform THEN the system SHALL remove associated tasks from the unified view
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a task manager, I want to create, edit, and delete tasks directly in the unified interface, so that I can manage my work without going back to individual platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to a specific connected platform
2. WHEN a user edits a task THEN the system SHALL sync changes back to the originating platform
3. WHEN a user deletes a task THEN the system SHALL remove it from both the unified view and the originating platform
4. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL queue the change for retry and notify the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project coordinator, I want to organize tasks by project, priority, and due date, so that I can effectively prioritize and plan my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are imported THEN the system SHALL preserve original categorization and metadata
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL display only tasks matching the selected criteria
3. WHEN a user sorts tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain the sort order across page refreshes
4. WHEN a user creates custom categories THEN the system SHALL allow tagging tasks with these categories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to see tasks assigned to me from Microsoft Teams and Planner, so that I don't miss any work assignments from my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Microsoft Teams integration is enabled THEN the system SHALL import tasks from connected Teams channels
2. WHEN a new task is assigned in Teams THEN the system SHALL add it to the user's unified task list
3. WHEN task status changes in the unified view THEN the system SHALL update the status in Microsoft Teams
4. IF Teams API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached tasks with a sync status indicator

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data-driven user, I want to import tasks from Excel spreadsheets, so that I can include my existing task tracking data in the unified system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an Excel file THEN the system SHALL detect and map task-related columns automatically
2. WHEN column mapping is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to manually map columns
3. WHEN import is complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary of imported tasks and any errors
4. IF the Excel file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL provide format requirements and examples

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my task data to be protected and my platform credentials to be secure, so that my sensitive work information remains confidential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN API calls are made to external platforms THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all session tokens
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to access my unified task list on my phone, so that I can check and update my tasks while away from my computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for small screens
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL allow viewing of cached tasks and queue updates for when connectivity returns
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync any offline changes
4. WHEN push notifications are enabled THEN the system SHALL send alerts for due dates and new assignments
